# SGEnable Health Portal

## SGEnable Health Portal is a website that instantly matches patients (with disabilities) with doctors that they need.

### About Our Idea 

Patients with disabilities often face multiple problems when trying to access and navigate to healthcare services, given the multiple hassles and troubles with getting an appointment, going to a medical institution, follow-up appoitnments etc. Through this initiative, we hope to simplify the process, tapping on voluntary medical practitioners, matching them with patients with disabilities who seek specialised medical attention.

### How It Works

Medical practitioners sign up using their own 'practitioner' sign-up form, indicating key fields like their specialisation, gender, experience, medical license verification as well as a brief description of the services they can provide. Upon log-in, doctors can see the contact details and description of patients.

Patients with disabilites can create a 'patient' account, through which they can input the type of specialist doctor they wish to see along with a brief description of their needs. They will also be able to filter search for the type of doctor they need and can access their professional details and contact details, should they wish to engage further.

### User Guide
